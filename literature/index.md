[Original Post and Specfication](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/)

To this, only two modifications have since been made:

* Introduction of blind merged mining.
* Forcing deposits to select the sidechain-UTXO as an input, such that all of the sidechain's money is always in a single UTXO. 

### Theoretical Work: Why it isn't bad that miners can rob the sidechain

[Video Series on "Sidechain Privatization", ie "smart contract ecology"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw8-6ARlyVciMH79ZyLOpImsMug3LgNc4)

The conclusions are summarized in this post about ["Wise Contracts"](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/wise-contracts/).
