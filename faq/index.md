### Are merged-mined sidechains secure?

The [security model](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/#drivechains-security) is comparable to Bitcoin's. Bitcoin protects all of the transactions over a recent period of time. Drivechain protects only a subset of these transactions, but it does so over a much longer period of time.

Security is higher when:

* The sidechain in question is popular with users.
* There are many popular sidechains.

A **more important point is this**: the risk-reward decision is one which should be up to each individual user. If you don't like a particular sidechain, or sidechains in general, then you don't have to use them!

But don't try to decide on behalf of other people! If each individual user is free to sell his/her BTC in exchange for an Altcoin (or for fiat), we can hardly deny users the opportunity to move *their money* between two sidechains.


### What negative impact could sidechains have on the mainchain (ie, Bitcoin Core)?

There are none, actually.

Users are free to ignore any sidechain software they don't like. And, thanks to something called ["blind merged mining"](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/), even miners are free to ignore sidechain software they don't like (while still being able to mine these sidechains for transaction fees).

This means that the sidechains are [completely firewalled](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/wise-contracts/) from each other. The mainchain cannot be harmed by the mistakes of its child sidechain. Even the [ecological effects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw8-6ARlyVciMH79ZyLOpImsMug3LgNc4) are neutralized.

In fact, because Drivechain is asymmetric (in that the child sidechain is subordinate to the parent mainchain), the mainchains cannot be harmed even by the *success* of their sidechains. Since Bitcoin Core would be the patriarch of this family of sidechains, Core would be the safest chain of them all.

### What kind of sidechain projects can we expect?

Please navigate to the [sidechain projects](http://www.drivechain.info/projects/index.html) section.

### When will be able to use Drivechain? What's your strategy for getting it into Bitcoin and activated?

I confidently estimate July 1st or earlier, but this will depend on feedback from users.

While technically, the Bitcoin network can upgrade via soft-fork at any time, traditionally we have always used a friendly ("patient"), process of accruing a 95% activation threshold. Which leaves the vote entirely up to the miners.

I expect Drivechain to be popular with miners. Sidechains mean more transaction fees for miners. They also mean a much cooler Bitcoin, which should mean a higher BTC price. Finally, Drivechain enables [larger blocks through a heavier sidechain](https://youtu.be/Gzg_u9gHc5Q?t=1h49m27s). Therefore, one might expect miners to activate the soft fork quickly. Optimistically, Drivechain could be available four weeks after miners decide to support it.

If miners refuse to activate the soft fork, it is still possible for users to activate it, and force it upon the miners (just as today's users force miners to enforce all activated soft forks -- activation of past soft forks is no longer optional for miners). This is riskier, but still very safe if user-support is overwhelming. If user-support is merely lukewarm (or unmeasureable), then we might turn to the exchanges for help.

The "blind merged mining" technology has not been developed. It will take an unknown amount of time to code and review.

### What's the rush? Aren't you worried about bugs?

I am worried about bugs! However, Drivechain's bugs can (probably) be found and fixed "in the wild". Bitcoin's design (particularly, the soft fork model), prevents any bugs in this software from affecting version that don't have Drivechain. This limits the potential damage tremendously (if not completely).

Secondly, software developers are often overworked, and can't prioritize their scarce review-time. Therefore, sadly, the projects that get the most attention are often those that "charge the mound", so to speak.
