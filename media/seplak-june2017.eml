You are simply incorrect, Greg. 51% of miners do not have "total" control
over coins...they do control the coin destination, but they can not
accelerate the timing nor overwhelm their parent chain with a high volume
of requests...in other words, they must subject themselves to a lengthy
delay, and make themselves vulnerable to a a trivial audit. Moreover,
before *any* of this, users must agree to subject themselves to these new
rules.

What if you were a developer of Firefox, and I said nonsense things like
"the Firefox application can have total control over your computer" or "the
vision is that everyone has to do everything in Firefox". The mistakes are
so large (you apparently do not understand chain reorganizations at all,
and your point about "limits user's choice" is nonsense) that one almost
doesn't know where to begin. You simply don't know what you are talking
about, and I will continue to embarrass you if you continue to make it this
easy.

You also consistently fail to make an important distinction, between two
positions:

(1) "I wouldn't move my BTC to a drivechain...I'm not into that kind of
thing."
(2) "I decree that no Bitcoin users anywhere should have the option to move
their money to a drivechain."

Many people (quite reasonably) hold the first position, but your position
is the 2nd. Who is "limiting user choice" now? You. And, since this is your
position, what do you do about Altcoins (which logically should be equally
outrageous to you) or for that matter Ethereum? The Bitcoin mailing list is
not about if individual users should-or-should-not spend to multisignature
outputs, or use the LN...it is about whether ideas might service at least
some users somewhere, and if they will break Bitcoin (as you ought to know)=
.

You need to decide how humiliated you would like to be. Further nonsense
will be published to the "Peer Review" page.

I would prefer it if you did not support Drivechain, because I only want
supporters who at least know the basics.

In Drivechain, 51% of miners have total control and ownership over all of
the sidechain coins. The vision of Drivechain is to have many blockchains
"plugged in" to the main chain.

Today, well over 51% of miners are under the jurisdiction of a single
government.

Thus the effect of Drivechain appears to be the creation of a new kind of
digital border imposed onto the network where everyone hands over ownership
of their Bitcoins to a /single/ mining cartel when they wish to interact
with /any/ sidechain.

Drivechain would be a reasonable idea if that weren't the case, but since
it is, Drivechain now introduces a very real possible future where Bitcoins
can be confiscated by the Chinese government in exactly the same manner
that the Chinese government today confiscates financial assets in other
financial networks within China.

One argument is that the psuedo-anonymity granted by Bitcoin addresses
could theoretically make this less likely to happen, and while that is
true, it is also true that every day Bitcoin becomes less and less
psuedo-anonymous as governments invest in blockchain analysis tech [1].

How many high-profile confiscations =E2=80=94 now via the Bitcoin-blockchai=
n itself
(no longer being able to blame a 3rd-party exchange) =E2=80=94 is Bitcoin w=
illing
to tolerate and open itself up to?

In a world before Drivechain: the worst that a 51% coalition can do is
prevent you from spending your coins (censorship).

In a world with Drivechain three things become true:

1. The Bitcoin network centralizes more, because more power (both financial
power and power in terms of capability/control) is granted to miners. This
is likely to have secondary consequences on the main-chain network as well
(in terms of its price and ability to evolve).

2. A 51% coalition =E2=80=94 and/or the government behind it =E2=80=94 is n=
ow able to
financially profit by confiscating coins. No longer is it just censorship,
"asset forfeiture" =E2=80=94 theft =E2=80=94 becomes a real possibility for=
 day-to-day
Bitcoin users.

3. Drivechain limits user's existing choice when it comes to who is acting
as custodian of their Bitcoins, from any trustworthy exchange, down to a
single mining cartel under the control of a single set of laws.

The argument given to this is that a UASF could be initiated to wrest
control away from this cartel. I do not believe this addresses the concern
at all.

A UASF is a very big deal and extremely difficult to pull off correctly.
Even when you have users behind you, it *requires* significant support from
the miners themselves [2]. Therefore, I do not believe a UASF is a
realistic possibility for recovery.

I would only support Drivechain if all of these issue were addressed.

Kind regards,
Greg Slepak

Hi everyone,

It has been 3 weeks -- responses so far have been really helpful. People
jumped right in, and identified unfinished or missing parts much faster
than I thought they would (ie, ~two days). Very impressive.

Currently, we are working on the sidecha...
